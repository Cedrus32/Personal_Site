Some new aquisitions, including the Paradise and the v2 True Friends Flames set.

    Although the Paradise was officially released in the US on August 1st, it's been difficult to find due to limited in-store locations and resellers online. I was lucky enough to make it to a Tamagotchi USA Road Trip stop and pick one up at the merch booth there. I typically play Connection era devices, so the Paradise gameplay has been a fun change!

I also stumbled upon a long-time dream shell set -- the v2 True Friends Flames set. When I first got back into collecting, this set stood out to me the most, and I have only come across the black shell in less than ideal condition (for me, at least). Lo and behold a week or so after sharing this with the local collectors' club, I stumbled upon a listing for the pair in excellent condition!

Since life is extra busy, I'm focusing on running the Paradise, Akai Viking, and Akai Pink Grapes. Check them out on the <a href="/tamas/runs">runs page</a>.
