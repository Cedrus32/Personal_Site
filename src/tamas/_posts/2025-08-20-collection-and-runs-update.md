It's the end of summer, and I'm reaching a point where I've aquired many of the shells and releases I've been eying since starting my collection several years ago. To the <a href="/tamas/collection">collection page</a>, I've added a few tamagotchis (two Angels and a Friends) and a new collection section for my GigaPets.

I'm also running several new shells in celebration of fair season and American football season! Check them out on the <a href="/tamas/runs">runs page</a>.
