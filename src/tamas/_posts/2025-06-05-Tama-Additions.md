I've acquired several new Tamagotchis.

        <figcaption>Guts Summer</figcaption>
        <p>Guts Summer was difficult to find, but I managed it! I want to run this is the tama (along with Guts Swimming, currently en route) over summer break.</p>

        <figcaption>Lemon Yellow</figcaption>
        <p>I was drawn to the bright yellow and TMGC logo on the Lemon Yellow shell. It reminds me of my old-school Neopets username, too. Very nostalgic.</p>

        <img src="/assets/images/tama_collection/pearl_purple.jpeg" alt="pearl_purple" />
        <figcaption>Pearl Purple</figcaption>
        <p>Pearl Purple was an impulse buy. Purple being my favorite color, and being a shiny shell, I vibed with it. I made a lowball offer and the seller accepted!</p>

        <figcaption>Pochitchi Comic</figcaption>
        <p>Pochitchi Comic completes the Oritama comic book shells (not including special editions). Yay!</p>
