Since last posting, I have been updating some technical bits of the site.

-   Growth charts now viewable as tables for improved tabability and readability
-   All data files refactored to have consistent structure, readibility, and easier liquid templating
-   New liquid templates available in cases of repeated code
-   Settings scripts now work with session storage (previously local storage) to better respect system preferences
-   Site animations now respect system motion preferences when JS is disabled
